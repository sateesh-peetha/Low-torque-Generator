# Low Torque Generator – Open Source Clean Energy Innovation  

## 🚀 Project Overview  
This project presents an **innovative low-torque generator design** aimed at revolutionizing clean energy generation. As global energy demands continue to rise, sustainable and efficient solutions are needed now more than ever.  

### **Why Open Source?**  
I, **Sateesh Peetha**, have developed this generator but **lack the funds to apply for a patent**. Instead of delaying progress due to **24/7 surveillance and external obstacles**, I am making this design publicly available on GitHub. This ensures my invention is **documented and claimed under my name** while allowing the world to benefit from it.  

Now, the real question is:  
**Will this innovation be fairly attributed to me, or will it be stolen without recognition?**
